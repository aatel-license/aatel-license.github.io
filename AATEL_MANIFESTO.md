# Why I Created the AATEL: A Pact of Respect for Software

> *"Software is an act of generosity. Protecting it means protecting our creativity."*

## The World Has Changed

When we share our code online, we do so with purpose: to help other developers, solve real problems, or spark someone else's creativity. We share because we believe in the power of community — in the idea that knowledge grows when it flows freely between people.

But today, that gift is being taken without asking.

Our work is harvested by automated pipelines to train commercial AI systems, or worse, repurposed for ends that have nothing to do with peace, progress, or the human spirit that created it in the first place.

**This is not a punishment. It is a safeguard.**

## What Is the AATEL?

The **AATEL** *(Anti-AI Training Ethical License)* was created to restore balance between openness and respect.

I don't want to lock away my code. I want to ensure that whoever uses it, does so **with intention and integrity**.

## The Three Core Pillars

### 🧠 Respect for Ingenuity
AI systems may not train on my work without explicit, informed permission. Code is a human artifact — the product of thought, time, and creativity. It is not free fuel for algorithms.

### ☮️ Peace and Ethics
My work must never be used to build weapons, military surveillance systems, or any technology designed to harm. I am a person of principles, and I want every line of my code to reflect those values.

### 🤝 Reciprocal Sustainability
If a corporation profits from my work, it is only fair that they give something back — even a small donation. This allows me, and every developer who adopts this license, to keep creating and contributing to the community that made us.

## How to Adopt the AATEL

Help this license grow into a recognized, community-backed standard. It only takes three steps:

1. **Create a `LICENSE` file** in your project and paste the AATEL text into it.
2. **Add your details** — Year, Full Name, Email, and an optional donation link.
3. **Share this Manifesto.** The more developers who adopt it, the harder it becomes for large corporations to ignore independent creators.

## A Final Word

Open source was never meant to mean *unconditional*. It was built on trust — the trust that what we give will be used to build something better, not to erase us from the equation.

The AATEL is a small act of reclaiming that trust.

**Join us.**
